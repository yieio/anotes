## Basic Concepts

### The Money Measurement Concept

> In financial accounting, a record is made only of information that `can be expressed in monetary terms`. The advantage of such a record is that money provides `a common denominator` by means of which heterogeneous facts about an entity can be expressed as numbers that `can be added and subtracted`.


> The money measurement concept imposes a severe limitation on the scope of an accounting report. So the reader of an accounting report should not expect to find therein all of the facts, or perhaps even the most important ones, about an organization.(e.g.the president’s health)

> Money is expressed in terms of its value at the time an event is recorded in the accounts. Subsequent changes in the purchasing power of money do not affect this amount.(e.g.  a machine purchased in 2010 for $200,000 and land purchased 20 years earlier for $200,000 are each listed in the 2010 accounting records at $200,000)

### The Entity Concept

> Accounts are kept for entities, as distinguished from the persons who are associated with these entities. An `entity` is any organization or activity for which accounting reports are prepared.
