## Basic Concepts

### The Money Measurement Concept

> In financial accounting, a record is made only of information that `can be expressed in monetary terms`. The advantage of such a record is that money provides `a common denominator` by means of which heterogeneous facts about an entity can be expressed as numbers that `can be added and subtracted`.


> The money measurement concept imposes a severe limitation on the scope of an accounting report. So the reader of an accounting report should not expect to find therein all of the facts, or perhaps even the most important ones, about an organization.(e.g.the president’s health)

> Money is expressed in terms of its value at the time an event is recorded in the accounts. Subsequent changes in the purchasing power of money do not affect this amount.(e.g.  a machine purchased in 2010 for $200,000 and land purchased 20 years earlier for $200,000 are each listed in the 2010 accounting records at $200,000)

### The Entity Concept

> Accounts are kept for entities, as distinguished from the persons who are associated with these entities. An `entity` is any organization or activity for which accounting reports are prepared.


### The Going-Concern Concept

> Unless there is good evidence to the contrary, accounting assumes that an entity is a `going concern`—that it will continue to operate for an indefinitely long period in the future. 

> The significance of this assumption can be indicated by contrasting it with a possible alternative, namely, that the entity is about to be `liquidated`.


### The Cost Concept

> The economic resources of an entity are called its `assets`.

- nonmonetary assets (e.g. land, buildings, and machinery, and other similar assets whose cash value is not fixed by contract)

- monetary assets (e.g. money and marketable securities and other similar assets whose cash value is fixed by contract)

#### Nonmonetary Assets

> In accounting, all assets are initially recorded at their cost. (For emphasis, this is also referred to as an asset’s historical cost.) In the case of nonmonetary assets, this amount is ordinarily unaffected by subsequent changes in the value of the asset. 

#### Rationale for the Cost Concept

> 是权衡relevance, objectivity, and feasibility 三者之后做的一个折中
  
  - 不够 relevance 因为他给出的不是 nonmonetary asset 当前的价值
  - 相对 objectivity ,是跟每次都评估资产的当前价值这种方法比，因为每次都评估会很困难而且相对会很主观
  - 更可行 The cost concept leads to a much more feasible system of accounting for nonmonetary assets. 
  - So adherence to the cost concept when accounting for nonmonetary assets indicates a willingness on the part of the accounting profession to sacrifice some degree of relevance in exchange for greater objectivity and greater feasibility.

> The purpose of the `amortization` process is to remove systematically the cost of the asset from the asset accounts and to show it as a cost of operations. 

#### Monetary Assets

> Monetary assets are initially recorded at their cost and, in the case of most monetary assets, subsequently accounted for at their fair value. 


#### Rationale for Fair Value

> The use of fair value to account for most monetary assets subsequent to their acquisition satisfies the three basic criteria of `relevance`, `objectivity`, and `feasibility` used to judge the acceptability of an accounting principle. Clearly a monetary asset’s fair value is relevant to readers of accounting reports, and the fair value of many monetary assets can readily be determined objectively and at a low cost.

#### Goodwill

> It follows from the cost concept that if an entity pays nothing for an item it acquires (other than as a donation), this item will usually not appear on the accounting records as an asset. 

> Goodwill appears in the accounts of a company only when the company has purchased another company, when one company buys another company and pays more than the fair value of its net assets.

> representing the value of the name, reputation, clientele, or similar intangible resources of the purchased company.
